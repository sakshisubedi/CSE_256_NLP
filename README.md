## Exploring Machine Learning and Few Shot Techniques for Text Classification

Explored various Machine Learning Models (Logistics Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM), Deep Learning Models (LSTM, TextCNN), and Few Shot Techniques using BERT and SetFit Model in Kaggle IMDB and AG News Dataset.

The project report can be found [here](./Project_Report.pdf)

### Results
|      | Logistic Regression | Naive Bayes | SVM | LSTM | TextCNN | Few-Shot using BERT | Few-Shot using SetFit |
| ---- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **IMDB Dataset** | 90.02%  | 86.35%  | 90.95%  | 87.73%  | 89.54%  | 80%  | 98%  |
| **AG News Dataset** | 91.37%  | 90.21%  | 92.22%  | 91.47%  | 91.83%  | -  | -  |
